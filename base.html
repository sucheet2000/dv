  <h1>Waste Management Across Various SCU Buildings: A Visual Exploration</h1>
   
  <section id="project-section">
    <h2>About the Assignment</h2>
    <p>Upon examining the dataset, I initially found it unclear what insights could be derived from it. However, upon closer inspection, I discovered that it contained information about the waste generated at SCU (Santa Clara University). My initial intention was to analyze which event produced the highest amount of waste. Unfortunately, I noticed that the dataset did not include any information about the specific event associated with the waste collection. As a result, I shifted my focus and realized that there might be an intriguing pattern in the distribution of waste streams throughout the campus</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I have cleaned the data and used that dataset. I have added that cleaned dataset to the zipfile.</li>
        
        <li>When you hover over a sector in the chart, it displays the total weight of waste associated with that particular combination of stream and building.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
    
    <section id="project-section">
    <h2 style="margin-left: 15px">Project Display</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px">It uses this data to generate a 'SUNBURST CHART', where the waste streams and buildings are organized in a hierarchical structure.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px">The size of each sector in the chart represents the weight of waste associated with that particular combination of stream and building.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px">The circular layout of the sunburst visually conveys the proportions and relationships between waste types and buildings.</p>
      </section>
    
    <section id="project-section">
    <h3 style="margin-left: 20px">Size and Color</h3>
     <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">   
    <li>The size of the visualization is set to 1100x850 pixels to provide a spacious canvas for the chart and ensure optimal visibility of the data.</li>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Color plays a crucial role in conveying information effectively. In this visualization, I have used a specific color scheme to represent each waste type: </p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li>Landfill: #cacbcc (a light gray shade)</li>
  <li>Compost: #8dd08a (a green shade)</li>
  <li>Recycling: #2cb4f8 (a blue shade)</li>
</ul>
    <section id="project-section">    
    <h3>Other Visual Elements</h3>
    <p>To improve the user experience, I have incorporated interactive features:  </p>
    <li style="margin-left: 20px"><strong><u>Hover Information:</u></strong> When users hover over a specific segment, a tooltip displays the total weight of waste for that particular waste type and building. </li>
    <li style="margin-left: 20px"><strong><u>Legend:</u></strong> A legend is included to provide a clear understanding of the color coding for each waste type. </li>
    </section>
        <div id="sunburst-graph"></div>
        <script>
            // Parse the JSON representation of the figure
            var graphJSON = JSON.parse('{{ fig_json | safe }}');
            // Display the sunburst figure
            Plotly.newPlot('sunburst-graph', graphJSON.data, graphJSON.layout);
